We cumulate returns until one (trading) day after the announcement date to account for the one-day-delayed reaction to earnings news. r md is the value-weighted market return for the Abr deciles with NYSE breakpoints and value-weighted returns, but is the equal-weighted market return with all-but-micro breakpoints and equal-weighted returns.",,

We require at least one of the three expense items (COGS, XSGA, and XINT) to be non-missing. Book equity is stockholders’ book equity, plus balance sheet deferred taxes and investment tax credit (item TXDITC) if available, minus the book value of preferred stock. Stockholders’ equity is the value reported by Compustat (item SEQ), if it is available. If not, we measure stockholders’ equity as the book value of common equity (item CEQ) plus the par value of preferred stock (item PSTK), or the book value of assets (item AT) minus total liabilities (item LT). Depending on availability, we use redemption (item PSTKRV), liquidating (item PSTKL), or par value (item PSTK) for the book value of preferred stock.",,
